# ADV_MissionTemplate
Mission Template by Belbo for Spezialeinheit Luchs

Files open for editing are found in the \mission\-folder. Don't change description.ext if you don't know what you do - you might break the mission otherwise!
init.sqf, initPlayerLocal.sqf and initServer.sqf can be edited to your liking except for the first few marked lines.
The licence.txt MUST NOT be removed from the mission folder.

If you want to build a mission on the base of the ADV-Mission Template, you'll have to edit the following files first:

	mission\ADV_defines.hpp: Edit to your liking.
		You HAVE to change the following: MISSIONAUTHOR, MISSIONNAME and MISSIONPLAYERS

mission\adv_storyboard.sqf will be executed on server only or on HC if HC is present and the HC-parameter is selected in MP lobby.

Units named according to readmes\loadoutNames.txt will receive their loadouts automatically depending on selected uniform- and weapons-parameter in MP lobby.
Vehicles named according to readmes\vehicleNames.txt will be handled by vehicle exchange and respawn system (according to paramter in MP lobby) and have gear and variables fitting to side of players and their selected weapon sets.
If you don't use these names, I don't furnish a guarantee that your mission will be a success.

Don't EVER place playable units that aren't included in the base game (ie. vanilla units).

Most settings for this template can be altered in the MP lobby or in:

	mission\CfgParams.hpp (standards for MP lobby params)
	mission\CfgACEParams.hpp (standards for MP lobby params for ACEÂ³ - these overwrite the corresponding settings in mission\CfgACE.hpp)
	mission\CfgACE.hpp (ACE-Settings).

/////////////////////
Important variables:

//Turns true as soon as player has received his first loadout:

	player getVariable ["ADV_var_hasLoadout",false];

//turns true if a vehicle has been changed via lobby params:

	VEHICLE getVariable ["adv_var_vehicleIsChanged",false];

/////////////////////
Useful other commands:

//Put in init-line of unit to have it removed from garbage collection:

	removeFromRemainsCollector [this];

//Put in init-line of unit or vehicle to define it as ace_medical-doctor:

	this setVariable ["ACE_medical_medicClass", 2];

//Put in init-line of building to define it as ace_medical-medical-facility:

	this setVariable ["ACE_medical_isMedicalFacility", true];

//Put in init-line of vehicle to define it as ace_repair-repair-vehicle:

	this setVariable ["ACE_isRepairVehicle", 1];

//Put in init-line of vehicle to define it as ace_repair-repair-facility:

	this setVariable ["ACE_isRepairFacility", 1];

Have Fun!
